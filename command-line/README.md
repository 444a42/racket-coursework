Racket Scripts
==============

You can use racket as a scripting language, when I saw this on the racket
site I thought I should add this as a sub-project and document it

- The top of the file needs to point to racket
  - eg. #! /usr/bin/env racket
- You'll ned to chmod +x the file to make it executable
- Use the command-line procedure to parse input passed to the script
  via the command line
